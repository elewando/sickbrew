sickbrew - a JavaScript library for rich Magic: the Gathering content
Copyright (C) 2011 Eric Lewandowski

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

sickbrew is a JavaScript library that adds fancy and useful things to web
pages, particulary Magic: the Gathering strategy articles. It works by
looking for well-formatted "trigger" HTML in the source and amending the
document with its magic. For examples, see http://sickbrew.com/demo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the sickbrew library on your site, download the source or clone the
repository from github - https://github.com/elewando/sickbrew. Add a script
tag to the relevant pages:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/sickbrew/sickbrew.js"></script>

(Use the appropriate path.) sickbrew.js is designed to be light enough for
use in a global header; it only loads the bulk of the script if trigger
elements are present.

You may also include a version number in the src attribute:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/sickbrew/sickbrew-v5.js"></script>

If used in conjunction with a rewrite rule on your web server, you can
circumvent browser caching and change the version number, forcing the
library to download new source whenever you update the code. An appropriate
rule for Apache would be:

RewriteRule ^(.*)(-v\d+)\.(j|cs)s$ $1.$3s

Note that this is not a real version number; it simply tricks the browser
into ignoring its cached copy of any files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Card Data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make card data available, include a hidden input:

<input type="hidden" name="sickbrew_cards" value="som,mbs,nph" />

This example will make Scars of Mirrodin, Mirrodin Beseiged, and New
Phyrexia card data available in window.sickbrew.cards. Most other sickbrew
features will depend on this data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sealed Deck
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sealed Deck feature appends a deck builder to the page when it finds an
appropriate card pool. Card pool html looks like this:

<ul class="sickbrew_sealed">
<li>2 Apostle's Blessing</li>
<li>Exclusion Ritual</li>
etc
</ul>

The number of cards is optional; one is assumed if no count is present.
Card names that are present in the loaded card data will appear in the deck
builder; missing card names will be ignored. Once the builder is populated,
the user can manipulate cards, add basic lands, and generate a decklist for
use in article feedback.
